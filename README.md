# Minigrep
This project covers work undertaken while studying 'The Book'. Chapter 12 provides the reader with an opportunity to create a grep-like program.
An extension of the chapter is to make a variant of the project that accepts command line arguments.
The vanilla iteration of the project uses positional args to parse the request.
