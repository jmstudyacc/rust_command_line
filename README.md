# Grep-like Utilities
This project covers work undertaken while studying 'The Book' and 'Rust in Action' to create utilities that mirror grep functionality in some way. 
Chapter 12 of 'The Book' provides the reader with an opportunity to create a grep-like program.
Chatper 2 of 'Rust in Action' provides the reader with a similar opportunity.

The 'clap' crate has been used in enabling Arg parsing.
